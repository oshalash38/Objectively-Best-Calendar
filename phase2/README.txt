To start the program, if you are using intellij then set it up so that Main.java is the class you run.


Instructions:
1) In menus if you are given multiple options that are numbered you are required to input the number corresponding to your desired option.
   Note: Avoid entering wrong input when creating a new memo. Sometimes this causes a NumberFormatException. It will be fixed for Phase 2.


2) A timer refreshes every 30 seconds to check for new notifications. So any alert might be displayed at most 30 seconds
   after it is scheduled. If there are new notifications, you will automatically receive a message at most 30 seconds later.
